# Bioinformatics Learning & Projects Repository

This repository documents my bioinformatics learning journey, hands-on projects, and mini-projects from April 2025 onwards. It serves as a central place to organize and showcase my work as I prepare for my Master's in Bioinformatics starting January 2026.

## Folder Structure

- *Apr-Jun-2025* – Foundational concepts in Python, R, and basic bioinformatics.
- *July-Aug-2025* – Intermediate Python, mini-projects, and early bioinformatics exercises.
- *Sept-2025* – Projects in DNA biology, ORF translation, Biopython, BLAST, and phylogenetics.
- *Oct-2025 onwards* – Upcoming projects, advanced analysis, and preparation for Master's-level work.

## Highlights

- *Python for Bioinformatics:* Sequence handling, cleaning, GC content, transcription, translation, codon analysis.
- *Biopython Projects:* Pairwise alignment, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), working with FASTA/GenBank files.
- *BLAST & Phylogenetics:* Offline BLAST analysis, sequence fetching via Entrez, MSA, distance matrices, and phylogenetic trees.
- *Visualization:* GC content distributions, alignment inspection, and tree plotting using Matplotlib.

## Future Work

- Continue building hands-on bioinformatics projects and mini-projects.
- Explore more advanced sequence analysis, alignment strategies, and visualization workflows.
- Prepare for upcoming Master's-level work and more complex bioinformatics techniques.
