# July Python Projects

This folder contains Python projects completed in July, focusing on *string manipulation, **file handling, and **data analysis with Pandas & Matplotlib*. Each project is in its own Jupyter notebook with explanations and code.

## Subfolders

### 1. String Manipulation
Projects that explore DNA/RNA sequence manipulation, including:
- Reversing DNA sequences
- Generating reverse complements
- Counting motifs (e.g., ATG)
- Sliding window analyses
- Cleaning sequences and removing special characters
- Splitting multi-fasta sequences into lines
- Finding motif positions

### 2. File Handling
Projects demonstrating reading from and writing to files, including:
- Calculating GC content from files
- Counting nucleotides
- Writing and reading custom data files
- Simulating point mutations
- Translating RNA sequences to protein
- Comparing mutated proteins to wild type

### 3. Pandas & Matplotlib
Projects that integrate data analysis and visualization:
- Reading codon frequency data using Pandas
- Data exploration (sorting, filtering, grouping, aggregation)
- Plotting bar charts and stacked bar charts of codon frequencies
- Visualizing GC content across sequences with line plots
- Using Pandas for top-N analysis and summary statistics

Each project notebook contains:
- The problem or task description
- Step-by-step code with explanations
- Output results, plots, and insights
