# August 2025 Bioinformatics Mini Projects

This folder contains all mini-projects completed in August 2025, organized by topic. Each script has an associated Jupyter Notebook with code and explanations.

## Folder Structure

### Fasta-Parsing-Pipeline
- Functions for fast parsing, sequence cleaning, reverse complement, ORF frame detection, transcription, translation, and unique mutation simulation.
- Scripts include workflows to test sequences and demonstrate step-by-step pipelines.

### GC-Content-Mutation-Analysis
- Scripts focus on GC content calculation, GC sliding window, mutation simulation, and comparison of original vs mutated sequences.
- Includes use of *pandas* for data handling and *matplotlib* for visualizations (bar charts, line plots).

### ORF-Detection
- Scripts for detecting Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in single or multiple frames.
- Includes analysis of longest ORFs and integration with mutation simulation functions.

### Pandas-Matplotlib-Analysis
- Scripts performing *data manipulation, filtering, selection, grouping, aggregation*, and plotting of sequences and nucleotide statistics.
- Use of *pandas DataFrames* and *matplotlib* to visualize results.

### Text and Smple files
- Includes all CSV, TXT, and FASTA files created or generated during the projects.
- Files serve as *input sequences, test datasets, or **output results* from pandas and other scripts.

## Notes
- Each Jupyter notebook contains code, explanations, and sample outputs.
- Scripts are modular: functions defined in one script may be imported into others to demonstrate workflow integration.
- Visualizations and analysis focus on *sequence properties, **mutation effects, and **ORF identification*.
