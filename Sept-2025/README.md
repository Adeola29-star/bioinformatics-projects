# September 2025 - Bioinformatics Learning & Projects

This folder contains all the study materials, scripts, and mini-projects I worked on during *September 2025* as part of my bioinformatics learning journey. The focus for this month was on:

1. *Biology Foundations*
   - DNA, RNA, and protein structure
   - ORF finding, transcription, and translation
   - GC content calculations
   - Mini-projects involving sequence cleaning, analysis, and visualization
   - Files are organized by weeks: week1_dna_biology.ipynb, week2_orf_translation.ipynb, week3_biology

2. *BioPython*
   - Sequence handling with Biopython (Seq, SeqIO, SeqRecord)
   - Codon translation, reverse complements, and GC calculations
   - Pairwise sequence alignment
   - Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) with MUSCLE
   - Scripts include example FASTA files and results

3. *BLAST & Phylogenetics*
   - Local BLASTx analysis of multiple sequences
   - Parsing BLAST XML results into Pandas DataFrames
   - Phylogenetic analysis using Biopython:
     - Sequence download from NCBI Entrez
     - Sequence renaming and formatting
     - Multiple sequence alignment (MUSCLE)
     - Distance matrix calculation
     - Phylogenetic tree construction (Neighbor Joining)
     - ASCII and graphical visualization of trees
   - Mini-projects integrating sequence parsing, cleaning, ORF finding, transcription, translation, and alignment

## Folder Structure

- Biology/ – Weekly notebooks and mini-projects on DNA, RNA, protein, and mutations
- Biopython/ – Scripts demonstrating Biopython functionalities
- blast_and_phylogenetics/ – BLAST results, sequence analysis, and phylogenetic trees
- file_sample/ – Example FASTA and text files used in the projects

---

## Notes

- All scripts are *beginner-friendly* and designed for learning Python and bioinformatics simultaneously.
- Results and intermediate files are included for reference.
- Visualizations are saved as .png or .jpg for reports/presentations.
- This folder is part of my ongoing journey to build a *bioinformatics foundation before my Master’s program*.
