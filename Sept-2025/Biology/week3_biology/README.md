# Week 3: Biology - Genetics and Mutations

## Overview
This week covers biological concepts implemented in Python code:
- Gene regulation using the lac operon model
- Mendelian genetics: monohybrid and dihybrid crosses
- Simulation of mutations: substitution, insertion, deletion
- Mini project integrating genotype -> DNA -> mutations -> gene regulation

## Contents
1. gene_regulation.ipynb : Simulate lac operon response to glucose/lactose
2. mendelian_genetics.ipynb : Generate offspring genotypes and calculate ratios
3. mini_project_mutation_pipeline.ipynb : Mutation simulation and effect on gene regulation
4. mutations/ : Scripts for deletion, insertion, and point mutation simulations
