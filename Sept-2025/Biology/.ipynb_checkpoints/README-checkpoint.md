# September: Biology and Python Integration

## Overview
This folder contains all Python projects and scripts for September, integrating *biology concepts* with Python programming. The focus is on DNA/RNA analysis, genetics, ORFs, mutations, and gene regulation.

---

## Week 1: Sequence Analysis
*Folder:* Week1_Biology/  
- Functions for *FASTA file parsing*, sequence cleaning, nucleotide counting, GC content calculation.  
- Transcription (DNA -> RNA), complement/reverse complement, start codon detection.  
- Detection of *longest GC stretches* in sequences.  

---

## Week 2: ORF Detection and Translation
*Folder:* Week2_orf_translation/  
- File loading and cleaning for DNA sequences.  
- Detection of *Open Reading Frames (ORFs)* in three frames.  
- Translation of ORFs into *protein sequences*.  
- Demonstrations using practice3.txt.

## Week 3: Genetics and Mutation Simulation
*Folder:* Week3_biology/  
- *Gene regulation:* lac operon simulation based on glucose/lactose presence.  
- *Mendelian genetics:* monohybrid and dihybrid crosses; calculation of genotype and phenotype ratios.  
- *Mutation simulation:* substitution, insertion, deletion; effect on DNA and gene regulation.  
- *Mini-project:* integrating offspring genotypes → DNA → mutations → gene regulation.  
- *Mutation folder:* contains scripts for deletion, insertion, single-point mutations.  
- File examples: gene_regulation.py, mendelian_genetics.py, mini_project_mutation_pipeline.py, mutations/  

---

## Sample Files
*Folder:* file_sample/  
- Example input files used across scripts (.fasta, .txt).  
- Useful for testing functions and pipelines before applying to larger datasets.  

---

## Notes
- Each week’s folder contains a .ipynb file with all functions and an optional .ipynb notebook for demonstrations.  
- Projects progressively build from basic sequence analysis → ORF detection → protein translation → genetics and mutation simulation.  
- All scripts are beginner-friendly and demonstrate practical *bioinformatics workflows* using Python.
